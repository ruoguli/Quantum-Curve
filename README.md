# Quantum Curve Version 0.1.0
This is the first version of **Quantum Curve** (QC), which enables the reading of basic structures from chemical files such as .gjf, .mol, .mol2, .xyz, .pdb, and .inp (ORCA). I am working hard to improve this project. Theoretically, it can run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. However, considering that the project is still in **an extremely early version**, **only** the package for **Windows** is provided in the repository.💐
