# Quantum Curve Version 0.1.0
This is the first version of **Quantum Curve** (QC), which enables the reading of basic structures from chemical files such as .gjf, .mol, .mol2, .xyz, .pdb, and .inp (ORCA). I am working hard to improve this project. Theoretically, it can run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. However, considering that the project is still in ==**an extremely early version**==, only the package for ==Windows== is provided in the repository.üíê

## What we are doingüç¶
1. Right-click operation.
2. Customize the chemical bond type between atoms.
3. Support for more file types.
